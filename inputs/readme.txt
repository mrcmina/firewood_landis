*****************************

This folder contains all input files for LANDIS-ForCS simulations in the two
target landscapes: MRC Outauais (MRCOuta) and MRC Centre. 

All biomass-succession*.* files were prepared by Y.Boulanger. 
MaxANPP, MaxBiom and Pest tables are used as input in ForCS-succession, and were
originally derived from the gap model PICUS (see Boulanger et al 2016).

Specific information on the parameterization of forC-succession input files can
be found in firewood_landis/documentation

That experiment is mostly based on forest management scenarios, involving or not
the firewood harvesting. 
*****************************

This folder contains the input files and maps for the Base Harvest extension for
the two target landscapes

There are three versions of the harvesting prescriptions

1. base_harvest: timber and firewood harvesting prescriptions
2. base_harvest_fwRepeat: variant of the first in which firewood prescriptions
	is repeated multiple times
3. base_harvest_nofw: excluding firewood prescriptions
